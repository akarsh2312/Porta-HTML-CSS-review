Let's make a pizza restaurant menu page.

Start by sourcing in CSS.

Check to make sure it's got linked.

Create A Header:
-> Header is a container element:
    Elements used to contain other elements. Some have an implied meaning or usage, but all of them act like divs in terms of layout and style. (like <header>, <footer>, <main>)
-> Add an h1 for the header with our restaurant name
    opening tag and closing tag

-> Add an image
    self closing tag

    Some elements allow optional additional parameters called attributes which help spcodecify more about this particular element. Attributes include a specific keyword(src, class), an equal sign, and a value in double quotes (filname, className).
        <img src="fileName.img" class="pizzaImg"/>

-> Add a link to pizza Wiki
    difference between opening in same page or new page.

-> Maybe turn our image into the link.


Create a Footer:
-> Use < href="mailto"> to create a contact us link.

-> Add a h6 for a copy right

Create a Content Block:

We're going to create a menu, so I'm going to use some list properties.

Use a UL for types or unspecific items, and an OL to list the specific items.

Create a table with Pizza Prices.

Add a button for ordering - buttons are different than links - use buttons for clicking (accessibility).

----------------------------------
Once I get all my HTML on the page, Then I like to style it.

Hard to style and then do more HTML and then style and then do more HTML - could be kinda like shoveling while it's raining.

Header Style:
-> Use IDs when possible.
-> Add a background color.
-> Center the image.
-> Make h1 pretty.
-> Remove underline on link.

Content Style:
-> Remove bullets from UL.
-> Add a border.
-> Center div.
-> Make font look neat.

Footer Style:
-> Add background color.
-> Make it absolute with a left of 0 and width of 99% to fill up the space.
